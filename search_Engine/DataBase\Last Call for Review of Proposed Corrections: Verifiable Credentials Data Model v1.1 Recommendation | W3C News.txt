the verifiable credentials working group has proposed corrections to the w3c recommendation of verifiable credentials data model v1.1. credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver’s licenses are used to assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to travel between countries. this specification provides a mechanism to express these sorts of credentials on the web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable. comments, including implementation experience, are welcome via github through 18 january 2022. post navigation ← first public working draft: imsc hypothetical render model | blog home | authorized translation of wcag 2.1
